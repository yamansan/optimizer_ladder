## Known Issues

### üêõ Critical Issues
- **None Currently Identified**

### üîß Minor Issues
1. **Pricing Monkey Integration Timing**
   - **Issue**: Browser automation timing may fail on slow systems
   - **Impact**: Spot price refresh may occasionally fail
   - **Workaround**: Retry mechanism exists, manual retry usually succeeds
   - **Status**: Monitoring for frequency and considering adjustments

2. **Windows Path Handling**
   - **Issue**: Some hardcoded path separators may cause issues
   - **Impact**: Potential cross-platform compatibility issues
   - **Workaround**: Use os.path.join() consistently
   - **Status**: Being addressed incrementally

3. **Mock Data Consistency**
   - **Issue**: Mock data may not reflect all real API response variations
   - **Impact**: Development testing may miss edge cases
   - **Workaround**: Regular validation against real API responses
   - **Status**: Ongoing maintenance required

### üîç Under Investigation
1. **API Rate Limiting**
   - **Issue**: Potential rate limit issues during high-frequency operations
   - **Impact**: API calls may be throttled or rejected
   - **Investigation**: Monitoring API response headers for rate limit information
   - **Status**: Need to implement proper rate limiting compliance

2. **Memory Usage**
   - **Issue**: Large datasets may consume excessive memory
   - **Impact**: System performance degradation with large position histories
   - **Investigation**: Memory profiling during high-volume periods
   - **Status**: Considering pagination and data cleanup strategies
